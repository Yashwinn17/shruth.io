            <h3>Frontend Developer!</h3>
            <p>I am a highly motivated individual with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, where I achieved an outstanding cumulative GPA of 9.11/10. As an Associate Software Engineer at Hexaware Technologies, I gained extensive experience in customizing and developing features of the Duck Creek Policy product, demonstrating my proficiency in insurance solutions and troubleshooting techniques. Additionally, I have interned at Excelerate, where I focused on creating effective visualizations and data presentations, showcasing my skills in data analysis.
<br>
My passion for learning and exploring emerging technologies led me to undertake internships at Exposys Data Labs and Pantech-E-Learning, where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively participated in leadership roles such as Vice President of the Forum of Data Science Engineers (FODSE) and as a member of the Pan-IIT Alumni Leadership Series (PALS). I have also been recognized for my achievements, including receiving the prestigious Rajya Puraskar award in The Bharat Scouts & Guides. With strong communication skills in both Tamil (native) and English (near-native), I am dedicated to pursuing excellence in the field of electronics and communication engineering, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to drive technological advancements..</p>

As a Data Analyst at Excelerate in June 2023, my primary focus was on creating impactful visualizations and designing data presentations aligned with best practices. Previously, at Exposys Data Labs in October 2021, I specialized in Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques, specifically implementing the K-Means Clustering Algorithm for Market Basket Analysis. During my internship at Pantech-E-Learning in August 2020, I gained hands-on experience in Machine Learning, specifically in the areas of object detection, face recognition, and vehicle speed estimation using Neural Networks and OpenCV. These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques, allowing me to extract valuable insights and effectively communicate them to diverse audiences
